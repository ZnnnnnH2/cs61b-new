# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: i just accomplished draw, i don't came up with the idea that make Unit test for them, what i do just using my eyes to exam it. where to place looks like a math trike.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tessellation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: tessellating the rooms, generate hallways to connect the rooms.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: generate a signal room,with walls and floor, use some methods to connect room by hallways with floor, think about ways to generate walls and avoid conflicts, add a win rule to a certain room.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: hallway are just 1 or 2 tiles and random length
